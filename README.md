# Hi there! I'm Ty, IT Professional & Software Engineer
> Ty - Tyke - Tyrone

I build things to either solve problems, or to attempt my ***100000th*** startup idea. I'm passionate about learning and exploring new technologies by virtue of how many avenues they open up for innovation and critical thought. When I'm not working, you'll catch me tuning out to some music while working on my next project or certification
