# Hi there! I'm Ty 👋
> Ty - Tyke - Tyrone

Web Developer & Freelancer currently upskilling while searching for a full-time position. I build things to either solve problems, or to attempt my ***100000th*** startup idea. I'm passionate about learning and exploring new technologies by virtue of how many avenues they open up for innovation and critical thought. When I'm not coding, I rack up hours on Steam while trying to find the ***1000000th*** song to add to my Spotify playlist
